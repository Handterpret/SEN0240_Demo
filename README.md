# SEN0240_Demo
This repository contains code and documentation on how to collect data from an SEN0240 Electromyography sensor.
With this repoitory you should be able to visualise simple muscle contravtion.

## Hardware needed
A [SEN0240](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1661.html) is needed to get muscle contraction info.
An [Arduino](https://store.arduino.cc/) to compute data from SEN0240.

## Connection

The SEN0240 control board should look like this.
